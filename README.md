# JavaScript and Data Structure - Part 2 ( Queue )
Implementing Queue Data Structure in JavaScript

In this 2nd part , I'm going to implement QUEUE Data Structure. QUEUE follows FIFO principle. ( FIRST IN FIRST OUT ). Methods / Features available in a QUEUE Data Strucutre are the following

1.) Add Elements to End of QUEUE - enqueue() 2.) Remove Elements from begining - dequeue() 3.) Check first element value or value of the begining of the QUEUE 4.) Length of QUEUE 5.) Check whether QUEUE is empty or not 6.) clear all elements of QUEUE 7.) print all the elements in the QUEUE

Using JavaScript, I'm going to implement all the above methods in a function and that function can be used a QUEUE equivalent. We can use the QUEUE fucntion as a function constrcutor, then we can create new objects or we can create instances which will behave as a QUEUE.
